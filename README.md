This is my personal website https://ryansoeyadipianist.com. It's built using GatsbyJS along with many helpful plugins such as styled-components,  react-helmet, and more. Content such as blog posts, events, and images are all hosted on Contentful. The website itself is hosted on Netlify, which takes care of the form handling.
